                    <h3>What is JavaScript</h3>
                </header>
                <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to
                    the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic
                    typing, prototype-basedobject-orientation, and first-class functions </p>
                <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                    JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast
                    majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to
                    execute it.
                </p>
                <p>As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including
                    object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays,
                    dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as
                    networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is
                    embedded to provide these features.

                    <h3>Variables in JavaScript</h3>
                </header>

                    <li class="subsection">
                        <h4>Numerical variables</h4>
                        <p>Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. They do this by
                            using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. Any of the seven
                            data types may be stored in a variable.
                            Variablesare similar to the x and y variables you use in mathematics, which means they're a
                            simple name to represent the data we want to refer to. Computer variablesdiffer from
                            mathematical variables in that they can store different values at different times.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="subsection">
                        <h4>String variables</h4>
                        <p>
                            Computers distinguish between numbers, such as the number 12, and strings, such
                            as "12", "dog", or "123 cats", which are collections of characters. Computers can perform
                            mathematical operations on a number, but not on a string.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="subsection">
                        <h4 class="subsection">Storing Values with the Assignment Operator</h4>
                        <p>In JavaScript, you can store a value in a variable with the assignment operator.</p>
                        <code>myVariable = 5;</code>>
                        <p>This assigns the Numbervalue 5to myVariable.
                            Assignment always goes from right to left. Everything to the right of the =operator is
                            resolved
                            before the value is assigned to the variable to the left of the operator.</p>
                        <code>myVar = 5;<br>
                        myNum = myVar;</code>
                    </li>
                    <li class="subsection">
                        <h4 class="subsection">Undefined variables</h4>
                        <p>When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a
                            mathematical operation on an undefinedvariable your result will be NaNwhich means "Not a
                            Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefinedvariable, you will get a
                            literal string of "undefined".</p>

                    <h3>Quoting Strings with Single Quotes</h3>
                </header>
                <p>String values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end
                    with the same type of quote. Unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work
                    the same in JavaScript.</p>
                <code>doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string"; <br>
                    singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';</code>

                <p>The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in
                    a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation
                    in quotes. Another use for it would be saving an <a>tag with various attributes in quotes, all
                        within a string.</p>

                    <h3>Escape Sequences in String</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. There are two reasons to
                    use escaping characters: First is to allow you to use characters you might not otherwise be able
                    to type out, such as a backspace. Second is to allow you to represent multiple quotes in a
                    string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean. We learned this in the previous
                    challenge.</p>

                    <p>Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
                        n JavaScript, when the +operator is used with a Stringvalue, it is called
                        the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings
                        by concatenating them together.<br>
                        Example</p>
                    <code>'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'</code>
                    <p>Note<br>
                        Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll
                        need to add them yourself.</p>
                    <li>Constructing Strings with Variables</li>
                    <p>Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator
                        (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.</p>
                    <li>Appending Variables to Strings</li>
                    <p>Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append
                        variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator. </p>
                    <li>Use Bracket Notation to Find the Character in a String</li>
                    <p>
                        Bracket notationis a way to get a character at a specific indexwithin a string.
                        Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do.
                        They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.
                        For example, the character at index 0 in the word "Charles" is "C". So if <code>var firstName =
                        "Charles"</code>, you can get the value of the first letter of the string by
                        using firstName[0].

                    <h3>Understanding String Immutability</h3>
                </header>
                <p>In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
                    For example, the following code:</p>
                <code>var myStr = "Bob";<br>
                        myStr[0] = "J";</code>
                <p>change the value of myStrto "Job", because the contents of myStrcannot be altered. Note that
                    this does not mean that myStrcannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string
                    literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStrwould be to assign it with a new string,
                    like this:</p>
                <code>myStr="Bob" ; myStr="Job"; </code>
